# Introduction 
If this is your first mission in OPAR you should start reading in the order listed below.
Operation Active Resolve is a comprehensive campaign that will span over 30+ events. 
Because of this, there is a large background and supporting documents to setup the campaign.
In addition this campaign is unique because of volunteers filling the roles as the intelligence agency, Virtual Intelligence Service (VIS)
and volunteers in the role as Joint Force Air Component Command directing and commanding the Air Campaign. These roles do not have access to the .miz file
and is highly relient on pilot reporting during and after events.

## Step 1: Road to war
Start by reading the road to war. This gives a big picture understanding of the campaign.

## Step 2: Combined Joint Task Force 82 Operations Order
Next you should read the operations order for CJTF-82 which we all are a part of. This order gives the overall guidance to the entire force
(both ground, air and sea). This operation order is governing the entire campaign.
- [CJTF 82 OP ORDER](https://132nd-vwing.github.io/OPAR-Brief/ORDERS/OPAR%20CJTF82%20OPERATION%20ORDER.pdf)



## Step 3: Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP)
Next you should read the JAOP. This is the Joint Force Air Component Commands (JFACC) plan for how the air component (which we all are a part of) should execute 
the entire air campaign to solve the mission given in the CJTF-82 OP ORDER. This document is made fully by the volunteers based on availeble intelligence and guidance from 
CJTF-82.

## Step 4: Special Instructions (SPINS)
Next you should read the SPINS. This is a single document that governs air operations for the entire force. This document contains various information, such as command and control, 
risk levels, A-A information, tanker information etc.

## Step 5: Intelligence
Next you should read various intelligene products to get a more detailed understanding of the enemy, and the situation. Here you can do a deep dive, or you can skim the surface.
This step is something you should review before every event where you attend. Before each mission VIS will publish Intelligence Summarys (INTSUM) from the previous event.
INTSUMs contain relevant intelligence from the last event plus assessment for future events. (NOTE: VIS only get what pilots are reporting, so make sure to support VIS
by providing a accurate report after mission completion).
In addition to the VIS INTSUMs there is several other Intelligence Reports (INTREP) that cover certain topics.

## Step 6: Air Operations Directive (AOD) and Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL) 
At this point you are getting close to a event. Before each event JFACC will publish a Air Operations Directive (AOD) and Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL).
The AOD contains the JFACCs direction and guidance to all forces participating in the event. 
The JPTL contains the targets that the air component is tasked to attack on this specific event.
The Air Tasking Order (ATO) is created based on the AOD and JPTL.
These documents will be availeble on the main page for OPAR.



## Step 7: Air Tasking Order
At this point, you are now ready to start your detailed flight planning. You should now find your mission on the ATO (on the 132nd website). 
The ATO is availeble normally late friday evenings before a event on sundays. 
The ATO gives the necessary details required for your flight planning.
Additional information is availeble on the OPAR briefing main page, under mission information.



## Step 8: Fly your mission
Execute your mission



## Step 9: Reporting
After mission completion you should prepare a BDA / intelligence report / mission report. This report are to be reported on the correct channel on Discord.
This is the information that VIS uses to produce intelligence for upcoming missions, and JFACC uses as support to make decisions and provide direction and guidance.
All locations should be given in the following format DD MM.MMM  DDD MM.MMM. This makes the job for VIS much easier, as they can just paste the coordinates into CombatFlite.
If you only have bulls information, we kindly request you to use 1-2 minutes to convert it into correct coordinates before posting your report.



## Step 10: After Action Review (AAR)
The last step after a mission is to fill out a AAR on the 132nd website. The focus for the AAR is on giving everyone a common understanding on what happened in the mission
and share valuable learning points and what we can improve in later missions.

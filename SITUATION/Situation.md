## Strategic situation
In 2010 Iran conducted a attack against Pakistan. US and a coalition of the willing came to aid Pakistan. Combined Joint Task Force 87 was quickly assembled and conducted operations in the region.
CJTF-87 in cooperation with Pakistani forces were able to stop the Iranian aggression, and put the fight into Iranian territory. 
CJTF-87 invaded Iran and captured Kerman airfield, and also seized the Bandar Abbas Region in order to control the Strait of Hormuz. 
In february 2011 a cease-fire agreement was reached, and CJTF-87 are now occupying the SOUTH-EASTERN part of Iran (see picture below)

## Regional situation
UAE and Russia have strong ties, but UAE do not have good relations with Iran. 
UAE have allowed CJTF-87 to overfly its airspace in designated corridors, but have denied the use of UAE bases for operations in the region.
<br>
Oman have strong ties to Iran and have denied the use of Omanian airspace or territorial waters for any operations. 
Oman have also increased tension with UAE about a disputed area between Khasab and Omani mainland.  
Iranian backed insurgent group Alsyf Albarq (Lighetning Sword) is operating in the area to undermine UAE and are working for a reunification between the Omani enclave and the Omani mainland.
<br> 
Al Khan Brigade, a international terror organization with strong ties to Iran and Russia have been conducting multiple terror attacks in CJTF-87 controlled territory, 
and have also been reported to support Alsyf Albarq.

 TEST
 
------------------ TO BE DEVELOPED (INFORMATION BELOW IS NOT ACCURATE) ---------------

In May 2011 a US led Combined Joint Task Force, CJTF-87, was invited to come to UAE in order to function as a deterrence for any Iran provocations. 
CJTF-87 operates in UAE and OMAN in order to reassure the people of UAE and Oman that the allies is on their side of the conflict.

CJTF-87 mission originally had three parts:
1. Deter IRAN aggression.
2. Counterinsurgency (COIN) against Alsyf Albarq.
3. Counterterrorism (CT) against Al Kahn Brigade.
CJTF is invited in by UAE and OMAN, and operates in both countries.

CJTF-87 is heavily reliant on air forces, as the build-up of major land forces takes time.

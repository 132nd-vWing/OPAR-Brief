-------------------------------- TO BE DEVELOPED (INFORMATION BELOW IS NOT ACCURATE) --------------------------------

In May 2011 a US led Combined Joint Task Force, CJTF-87, was invited to come to UAE in order to function as a deterrence for any Iran provocations. 
CJTF-87 operates in UAE and OMAN in order to reassure the people of UAE and Oman that the allies is on their side of the conflict.

CJTF-87 mission originally had three parts:
1. Deter IRAN aggression.
2. Counterinsurgency (COIN) against Alsyf Albarq.
3. Counterterrorism (CT) against Al Kahn Brigade.
CJTF is invited in by UAE and OMAN, and operates in both countries.

CJTF-87 is heavily reliant on air forces, as the build-up of major land forces takes time.

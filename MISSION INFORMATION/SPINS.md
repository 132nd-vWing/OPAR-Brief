## AWACS

### HUMAN AWACS
When AWACS is manned by a human controller, all flights are to check-in on AWACS check- in on check-in frequency, unless otherwhose coordinated with AWACS controller prior to event start.
AWACS may push flights to different frequencies depending on the situation.
<br>

A-G controller 1: 235.250 (GREY 6) <br>
A-G Controller 2: 234.500 (PINK 9) <br>
A-A Controller 1: 248.000 (GRAY 2) <br>

VHF Back-up: 122.250 (GRAY 10) <br>
<br>
<br>
### AI AWACS
If no human AWACS controllers are available, all flights are to check-in on check-in frequency and once checked-in, push to AWACS AI MAGIC frequency. Once RTB, flights are to check-out on AWACS check-in frequency prior to pushing to ATC.
<br>
#### AWACS AI Frequencies:
MAGIC: 301.0 <br>
FOCUS: 300.0 <br>
<br>
Additonal information about AWACS procedures, please have a look at:

## Aerial Refuelling
Tanker instructions

**Altimeter setting.**
Unless otherwise directed an altimeter setting of standard pressure setting (29.92) is to be used for AAR operations.

**Vertical separation.**
Receivers are to join from below and are to maintain a minimum of 1000ft vertical separation (unless otherwise directed by the controlling agency) , until visual contact have been made.

**Clearance.**
Receivers must receive clearance from the controlling agency (AWACS) before contacting the tanker.

**Joining procedures.**
The left side of the tanker is to be used for joining aircraft. The first receiver of a formation may join directly astern the boom, when the receiver has visually confirmed that no refuelling is in progress.
